This is the Wire Cell Gen package. It provides reference implementation of Wire Cell interfaces in ways that can be generated with no outside dependencies.

Functionality includes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item wire and cell geometry,
\item drifting charge deposition in the volume of the detector,
\item diffusion of these charges as they drift,
\item digitization of charge on the wire planes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

These layers can be used with other Wire Cell implementations. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item depositions from detailed simulation can be provided and then Gen\textquotesingle{}s drifting, diffusing and digitization can be used.
\item your own wire geometry can be used with Gen\textquotesingle{}s cell construction or Gen\textquotesingle{}s wire generated wire geometry can be used as input to your own cell construction. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
